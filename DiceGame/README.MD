Hello! This a two player dice game inspired by a board game my little sister played while I
was visiting her over winter break. 

As you'll notice, there's little to no documentation; sorry about that. I made it as a spur of the
moment kind of thing not expecting anyone else to see it. The program should run smoothly; if not, the code, while
hairy, isn't difficult to fix. I believe in your abilities :D

Oh! I don't know why you would want to, but if for whatever reason you want to use the code for something else, go for it;
no credit or mention needed.
